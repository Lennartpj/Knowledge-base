### What is Ansible?

Ansible is the leading free and opensource configuration management, automation tool. With Ansible, [[Linux]] users can control and manage hundreds of servers from a single server known as the Ansible Control Node. Ansible makes it possible for System and Network administrators to provision software and settings on various network devices. Ansible can be used to manage both Unix and Windows host systems. Unlike many other automation tools such as Chef and Puppet, Ansible does not require the installation of agents on remote devices. Ansible rides on SSH protocol to communicate with remote host systems. Without the need of installing agents on remote systems, Ansible comes highly recommended since very little CPU and RAM resources are used up by remote systems.
